# How to contribute

BIMFAM welcomes changes big and small.

The best first way to contribute is to [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/BIMFAM/yunggh/issues/new) with your idea for a feature or fix. We try to respond within three days, so feel free to ping the thread if we're taking longer. 

Once the issue is discussed, or if you feel the change is best demonstrated with code, new contributors can submit submit changes via [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your fork of the repo. Regular contributors may be added to the BIMFAM GitHub org and contribute via PR from a branch.

Changes are typically approved fastest when they're well-tested, match the surrounding code style, and feature good docs and commit messages.

BIMFAM recommends contributors use Microsoft Visual Studio.
